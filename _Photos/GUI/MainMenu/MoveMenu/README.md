  Move Algorithm Screen. The algorithm is still a work in progress, however the idea is that the user would enter an (x,y,z) coordinate, click "submit", and the arm would travel to or align itself with that coordinate. The current (x,y,z) coordinate and angle measures for each servo are also displayed.

  <br>
  Move Angles Screen. The user may enter the angle measures for the servo they would like to move. By clicking "submit", the servos move to the user input angle measures.
